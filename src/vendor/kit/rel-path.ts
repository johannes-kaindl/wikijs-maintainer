// vendored from code-kit@0.31.0, src/ts/pure/rel-path.ts — do not hand-edit; re-vendor via tools/sync-kit.sh
/** The segment rules of a relative path that must stay inside a root (a vault, a sync folder, an export folder): no `..`
 *  that leaves it, no absolute path, no empty or `.` segment that makes two spellings of one file, no `\` that one platform
 *  reads as a separator and another as a name, no NUL. String logic only — it never touches a file system and never decodes
 *  (`%2e%2e` is a name here; a caller that reads URIs decodes first).
 *
 *  Origin: six local versions of the same few lines, measured 2026-10-18, each with its own outcome:
 *  - koda-agent `core/tools/path-guard.ts` `resolveNotePath` / `resolveFolderPath` and vault-rag `retrieval_facade.ts`
 *    `resolveNotePath`: split at `/` and `\`, drop empty and `.` segments, a leading `/` is an error (folder variant: dropped),
 *    `..` throws — {@link normalizeRelPath};
 *  - wikijs-maintainer `core/paths.ts` `anchorFromFrontmatter`: **nothing is rewritten**, an empty, `.` or `..` segment or a `\`
 *    makes the whole value unusable (`null`), because the value is a name that goes to a server — {@link checkRelPath};
 *  - 3d-codeblocks `core/gltf-uri.ts` `classifyUri`: a reference is resolved against the folder of the model, `..` climbs inside
 *    the vault and is refused only where it would leave it — {@link resolveRelPath};
 *  - vault-crews `core/paths.ts` `normalizeVaultPath`: like the first group, but it **kept** a `.` segment (`./a` stayed `./a`,
 *    so a deny-list written for `a` did not see it) — the kit drops it;
 *  - obsidian-kit `obsidian/share-export.ts` `assertFileName`: the name must be ONE segment — {@link isPathSegment}.
 *
 *  Three results differ from every local version, on purpose: a NUL byte is refused everywhere (only share-export did), and a
 *  segment that is `.` or `..` once its whitespace is trimmed (`".. "`) counts as `.` or `..` (a file system that trims trailing
 *  blanks reads it so). A leading `\` is, as in all six, a separator and not an absolute path. A Windows drive letter (`C:/x`) is
 *  not a form this module knows. Look-alikes are the caller's too, like percent-encoding: `U+2215`, `U+FF0F` or the full-width `．．／` are names here, and
 *  `U+200B` is not whitespace to `trim()`; a caller that normalises with NFKC or applies a Windows best-fit mapping afterwards does
 *  it before this module, not after. `absolute: "strip"` in {@link resolveRelPath} reads `/a` as `a` **below the base** (the
 *  3d-codeblocks reading), not below the root; `baseDir` is the caller's own folder and gets no absolute check.
 *
 *  Pure, no I/O; linear in the length of the path (tested at 1 000 / 10 000 / 50 000 for many segments, separators and dots). */

/** Why a path was refused. `empty`: nothing is left (or nothing was given); `absolute`: starts with `/`; `backslash`: a `\`
 *  in a path that is checked, not rewritten; `empty-segment` / `dot-segment`: `//` or `/./` in a path that is checked, not
 *  rewritten; `traversal`: a `..` segment that is not allowed (any, in {@link normalizeRelPath} and {@link checkRelPath}; one
